# Chamberlain lab proteomics

Chamberlain lab proteomics is an R file created to analyze a set of mulit-TMT proteomics data from gastrocnemius skeletal muscle derived from healthy mice, mice with
loss-of-function mutations in the Dmd gene encoding dystrophin (mdx4cv mice), and mdx4cv mice treated with microdystrophin or split intein-AAV dystrophin constructs to restore various-length dystrophin protein 
in mdx4cv skeletal muscle compartments.

This analysis file includes code to filter and visualize data using the gplots, VennDiagram, and dplyr packages in R.
This file also contains code to generate volcano plots using the tidyverse R package, generate principal component analysis (PCA) plots using the ggfortify R package, and perform one-way ANOVA statistical analysis
using the HybridMTest package in R.
